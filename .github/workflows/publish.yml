      # Build is handled by prepublishOnly, but we run it here explicitly to fail fast if build fails
      # and to have artifacts ready for JSR (if needed)
      # However, prepublishOnly will run again. To save time, we could skip it here,
      # but we need build for JSR publish probably?
      # JSR usually takes source. Let's assume standard npm publish flow.
      # We will just let prepublishOnly handle the build for npm publish.
